rotations
L -> lower (left)
R -> higher (right)
distance

So, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0.

left from 0 = 99
right from 99 = 0

start 50


The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.

L68
L30
R48
L5
R60
L55
L1
L99
R14
L82

The dial starts by pointing at 50.
The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82.
The dial is rotated L30 to point at 52.
The dial is rotated R48 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated L5 to point at 95.
The dial is rotated R60 to point at 55.
The dial is rotated L55 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated L1 to point at 99.
The dial is rotated L99 to point at 0.
The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.
The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.
